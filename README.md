# NezuLoader

this was originally made as an addon for OTCv3 and a "decent" VAC bypass injector.

It eventualy became a testing ground for stuff I was working on.

It includes the server crasher in a functional form.

To Load it either inject the `NezuLoader.dll` into csgo or use the injector and select 
`Nezu Loader` as the injection mode (and an optional dll to inject along side it if you want)
